# Event-Management-System
### Console-Based-Application
This is a console based application that allows the user many options for his/her choices. It has a menu driven approach and takes real time data from the user for data manipulation.
There is no storage of any kind used (data is deleted after the Application is terminated) for now. I have used Java Collections for multiple entry of user defined objects,an Interface implemented by Event class for a manipulation methods and many inbuilt java functions for data records and retrieval.

This application allows the user to :\
1)Enter an Event or multiple Events\
2)Display list of all the Events\
3)Update a part of a particular Event\
4)Delete an Event\
5)Search an Event based on various parameters and list it\
I am still Figuring out the finishing and enhancement.
